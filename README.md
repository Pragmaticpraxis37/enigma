#Functionality
* Meets Expectations as encrypt, decrypt, and the CLI methods function.

#OOP
* Above Expectations as a Shiftable module was created that houses the
following methods #create_sub_keys, #create_sub_offsets, and #create_shifts.
The Cipher and Decipher class both use all of the methods contained in the
module.  

#Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
* Meets Expectations as the code follows basic mechanics such as indentation
and line spacing.  Naming conventions are followed.  Enumerables and data
structures are efficient for the task at hand, though certain choices could
probably be made differently.  For instance, the encrypt method in the
Cipher class is lengthy and, while I do not know of a more succinct structure,
I am confident that it exists.  Additionally, there are a couple of methods
are over 10 lines.  

#Test Driven Development
* Meets Expectations as each method is tested and there is high coverage as
shown by SimpleCov.  Certain edge cases are addressed, such as numbers that are
generated by keys that are less than 5 digits being padded with zeros.  All
aspects of each method are tested.  Some mocks and stubs are used; however, there
is room for further use of them.
